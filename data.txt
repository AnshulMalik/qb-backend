Ever got bored with hefty work, collaborating with co-workers, associates, colleagues. Are you a flock user? Do you have a serious team working on an awesome project and need intellectual breaks between? Felt like playing some games? Challenging colleagues about their knowledge?
Well here we come with a solution, a multiplayer game `qb`, the  cubical game for developers.

Flock no doubt provides the best facilities for its developers to develop the best product but it lacks in providing them refreshment at the time of work. So we `goTeam` brings you  the first  ever multiplayer platform for flockOS.
Every team needs refreshment while working over flock. Why don’t you make that an intellectual break? Increase your knowledge? Challenge co-worker? Play a multiplayer game ? So we are here to fill that space left out by the flock team providing refreshment for users.

So beyond hackathon, we would like to develop this application for android and as a desktop application for windows and linux.
